## Hi there 👋

I am a Rising Sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science @ The University of Michigan. I am a previous Data Science Intern with UChicago DSI & Incoming Data Science Fellow at JP Morgan Chase. Currently, I am a  scholar at Greenwood Project where I've been furthering my skills and learning Data Analytics with a focus on FinTech. I am also enrolled in the Global Career Accelerator course where I've completed relevant data analysis projects with companies like Intel & The Recording Academy.

I am highly interested in gaining more experience in the AI/SWE field! 🕺🏽
